✨ Key Technical Features
Performance Optimization: Implemented Route-level Lazy Loading using React.lazy and Suspense to ensure minimal initial bundle size.

Dark/Light Mode: Fully functional theme switching support integrated into the CSS architecture.

Responsive & Accessible: Mobile-first design ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
